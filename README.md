 ## Program Description
This project is a playable, modified version of the classic Battleship game. Players can place ships on a grid and play through the game until someone has won. There are a multitude of new features in the game, such as different weapons (Bomb, Space Laser, Sonar), and other fun additions such as a captain's quarter on each ship, and a 1x1 lifeboat that spawns on the grid once a player has sunk the Battleship. This game is meant to be played by two players on the same computer.

All documents can be found in the DOCUMENTS folder in this repository. There are no special installation instructions; to play the game simply run the "main" function and follow the instructions onscreen.
  
 ## Note about Github Wiki
 All teammembers are currently in the process of being approved for Github student benefits. As such, we do not yet have the capability to create a Wiki. All items that were supposed to be on the Wiki can be found on the agenda document in the DOCUMENTS folder.
